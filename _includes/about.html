                <h2>About Climate Change</h2>
                <p>Climate change has been described as the problem of our generation.  In the Rocky Mountain National Park area, an increase in temperatures could negatively affect birds, hydrologic variables, lakes, streams, wetlands, and local wildlife.</p>
                <p>We thought that showing the beauty of these factors could help in their case.</p>
                <p>We plan to hike and backpack the Rocky Mountain National Park to document glacial retreat, streamflow, snowpack, and the wildlife of the area.</p>
                <p>You can read more about us below, and if you have any questions feel free to contact us!</p>
